Sani is a responsive design application designed to ease many small mom-and-pop elder care facilities into the 21st century at a reasonable cost. Administrative tasks such as resident applications, employment applications, maintenance, and resident management have been moved to the cloud where they are accessible from anywhere. There are different multiple levels of permission for staff.

Owners / Administrators have the ability to view multiple facilities, add staff, send out invoices, receive payments, and track some basic metrics in the dashboard view.

Sani is a project built by Michal Kaszubowski.
