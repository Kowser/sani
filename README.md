Sani is a responsive design application designed to ease many small mom-and-pop elder care facilities into the 21st century at a reasonable cost. Administrative tasks such as resident applications, employment applications, and resident management have been moved to the cloud where they are accessible from anywhere, including an off-site owner. There are different permission levels for staff, as well as a maintenance feature.

Owners / Administrators have the ability to view multiple facilities, add staff, send out invoices, receive payments, and track some basic metrics in the dashboard view.

Sani is a private project built by Michal Kaszubowski.
