MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
_ STAFF
	_ add users with staff/admin roles
	x	assign users to facilities
	_ archive users & disable priveleges
	_ promote / demote users (except other Execs)
	_	remove users from facilities (except other Execs, or only Facility creator can do this?)
!	_ handle removed staff that belongs to no facility?

_	ALL should be able to
	x	mark maintenance request as Low / Med / High priority
		_	w/ text notification to the maintenance person?

_ AUTHORIZATION
	x limit access to controllers for staff / admin / exec
	x	limit access to residents view
!	_	limit access via curl/etc... programs to upgrade user's own role level (ie: Admin -> Exec)
	_ add staff permissions select collection needs fixing Exec vs Admin, none should see DevOps


=======================================================
FUTURE
_	Users may need to have roles dependent on facility location

CONTROLLERS
Registrations overrides?
ResidentApplications

CURRENT PROBLEMS
_	date pickers sucks -> look at mentorme to figure out how to display form dates to user correctly, and save in models correctly
_ maintenance (index) for mobile/desktop is duplicated; how can we clean this up?
