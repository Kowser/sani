MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
_	Admin / Owner should be able to
	_ PAYMENTS
		_	see total payments upcoming
		_	see total payments past due
		_	mark a payment as received
		_	mark a payment as deposited
		_	have payment reminders sent to resident POAs/Reps on a monthly basis
		_	have payment confirmations sent to resident POAs/Reps on a monthly basis
	_ RESIDENTS
		_ create new residents
		_	archive old residents
		_	basic contact information
		_	basic notes about residents, follow ups, etc... if necessary

_	Admin / Owner / Maintenance should be able to
	_	see all maintenance requests ordered by facility
	_	see only their respective facility maintenance issues
	_	mark maintenance request as Low / High priority, or Emergency w/ a text notification to the maintenance person
	_	mark maintenance request as finished

_	Users should have varying levels of access (Owner / Admin / Maintenance Staff (Read or Write))

THOUGHTS
_	I don't see a lot of use for the resident side of things, so it may be best to have a RESIDENTS table set up, and only use the USERS table for actual people who need to login (owners & staff). Keeps the tables more clean.
_ change USER to LOGIN? I think we're going to have a lot of profiles rather than users containing all of the information, perhaps even and ADMINISTRATOR profile




FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS
_ Residents w/ Logins should
	_ be able to change their login/password
	_	change their notification preferenes (same prefs that Admins can access)
